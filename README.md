# CVPR 2020: Multimodal Categorization of Crisis Events in Social Media

This is an unofficial implementation for the CVPR 2020 paper [*Multimodal Categorization of Crisis Events in Social Media*](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Abavisani_Multimodal_Categorization_of_Crisis_Events_in_Social_Media_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf).

## Note
This implementation follows the original paper whenever possible. Due to our urgent need for experiment results, we haven't had time to make it super configurable with clean handlers.


## To Run
- Initialize by running `bash setup.sh`
- Run the pipeline with `python main.py`

## Stats
We applied mixed-precision training, so it runs fast on GPUs with tensorcores (e.g. V100). The default configuration consumes about 13GB of GPU memory, and each epoch takes 3 minites on an Amazon `g4dn-xlarge` instance (with V100 GPU).

**Warning: Model is saved for each epoch, which means it consumes 400MB of disk every 3 minutes. Take this into consideration.**


## Confusions
### Equation 4
The authors stated that $$\alpha_{v_i}$$ was completely dependent on $$e_i$$, and $$\alpha_{e_i}$$ was completely dependent on $$\alpha_{v_i}$$, while the equations meant the opposite. The implementation will stick to the text instead of the equations.

### Self-Attention in Fully Connected Layers
After obtaining a multimodal representation that incorporates both visual and textual information, the authors used fully-connected layers to perform classification. Here the authors wrote 

> We add self-attention in the fully-connected networks. 

 We assumed that they meant 'we added a fully-connected layer as self-attention'.

### DenseNet
The authors did not give the size of the DenseNet they used.


## Todos
- Setting `num_workers > 1` deadlocks the dataloader.
